# Personal-Styling-Classes

Using SCSS to make a set of class names that can be used through a project to help alleviate and automate some styling tasks

## To Do

- Margin
- Padding
- Font
- Font size
- Color
- Background
- Font effects
- Overflow
- Sizing
- Units
- Animations
- Transitions
- Clamp

## How will this be done?

- I am planning on using python3 scripts to help automate some tasks. Python code will be place in scripts folder. A front end framework will be used to test out whether or not the effects have taken place or not.

## Why is this being done?

- This is to help alleviate some frustrations and help automate a lot of tedious tasks and to not become dependent on third party frameworks.
